We talk a lot. It's good to talk, it's best in person but much of it is happening on list serves and email cc chains a mile long. Often these discussions are focused on a single event or idea. Some people seek to obtain consensus from the community about their ideas. We want to create safe space for these discussions.

What if there was a solution that:

* enabled rich multi-layer discussion
* Allowed community led moderation
* Provided a way for anyone to create a discussion space and run it however they wanted
* Allowed community lead decision making

## There is!

And it happens to be one of the largest online communities in the world...
