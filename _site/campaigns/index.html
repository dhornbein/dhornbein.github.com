    			<p>We talk a lot. It&#8217;s good to talk, it&#8217;s best in person but much of it is happening on list serves and email cc chains a mile long. Often these discussions are focused on a single event or idea. Some people seek to obtain consensus from the community about their ideas. We want to create safe space for these discussions. Email keeps us talking to ourselves and isn&#8217;t very inclusive.</p>

<p>What if there was a solution that:</p>

<ul>
<li>enabled rich multi-layer discussion</li>

<li>Allowed community led moderation</li>

<li>Provided a way for anyone to create a discussion space and run it however they wanted</li>

<li>Allowed community lead decision making</li>

<h2 id='how_occupy_could_best_use_it'>How Occupy could best use it</h2>

<p>Reddit allows anyone to make <strong>subreddits</strong>. Each group, project, or campaign could have their own <strong>subreddit</strong>. Each <strong>subreddit</strong> can be maintained and run how ever the creators want to run it. Use it for consensus decisions, voting on ideas, sharing information, or starting discussions.</p>

<p>Each <strong>subreddit</strong> has one or more <strong>moderators</strong> that maintain the space.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll outline some potential use cases:</p>

<h3 id='setting_up_an_event'>Setting up an event</h3>

<p>Lets say that you&#8217;re putting together an <em>un</em>conference and want to figure out what programs people are interested in. You could create a <strong>subreddit</strong> and post all the potential programs, then visitors can login and <strong>upvote</strong> projects they want to go to.</p>

<p>Visitors can also comment on programs and discuss how to make them perfect.</p>

<h3 id='affinity_group_discussion_forum'>Affinity group discussion forum</h3>

<p>Your super awesome affinity group wants to have a private forum where you can discuss ideas, vote on proposals, and share interesting links.</p>

<p>Just put up a <strong>private subreddit</strong> and invite your people in there.</p>

<h3 id='an_alternative_to_mail_lists'>An alternative to mail lists</h3>

<p>Tired of ten million emails a day? Want to follow a list, but only want to know the most important threads? Make a <strong>subreddit</strong> that only allows <strong>self posts</strong>. Now visitors can make posts and others can <strong>upvote</strong> the best content. Each post on reddit can be commented on, each comment can be <strong>upvoted</strong> or <em>downvoted</em>* so the best stuff rises to the top.</p>

<p>Ready to get started?</p>

<h1 id='get_started'>Get started</h1>

<p>Visit <a href='//reddit.com]'>reddit.com</a></p>

<h2 id='create_an_account'>Create an account</h2>

<p><img alt='new account' src='http://i.imgur.com/3s2CVxy.png' /></p>

<p>Click the register link on the top right. Follow the instructions and setup your account.</p>

<h2 id='configure_your_account'>Configure your account</h2>

<p>The Reddit front page is an aggregate of all the <strong>subreddits</strong> that you subscribe to. Reddit automatically subscribes you to a few <strong>subreddits</strong>, these are garbage, you&#8217;ll want to unsubscribe from those.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Note: Reddit is a very diverse and awesome place full of amazing cool people, however, it is still the internet and the main demographic is young, white, privileged men (boys) so you&#8217;ll want to avoid some of the more &#8220;popular&#8221; subreddits unless you&#8217;re into immature oppressive, sexist, racist banter.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that you&#8217;re subscriptions are clean it&#8217;s time to subscribe some cool <strong>subreddits</strong>. I&#8217;ll be maintaining a <strong>subreddit</strong> of Occupy related <strong>subreddits</strong> at <a href='//reddit.com/r/interoccupy'>r/interoccupy</a></p>

<p>There are also some existing #OCCUPYWALLSTREET <strong>subreddits</strong> like <a href='//reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet'>r/occupywallstreet</a>, check it out. There&#8217;s already 30,000+ people subscribed to it!</p>

<p><img alt='r/occupywallstreet' src='http://i.imgur.com/UzHfxU4.png' /></p>

<h2 id='subscribing_to_subreddits'>Subscribing to subreddits</h2>

<p>All <strong>subreddits</strong> are found a reddit.com/<strong>r</strong>/subreddit you can pretty much put any topic in there and find a community. Like gardening, check out <a href='//reddit.com/r/gardening'>reddit.com/r/gardening</a> how about anarchy? <a href='//reddit.com/r/anarchy'>reddit.com/r/anarchy</a> more into flags? Just go to <a href='//reddit.com/r/vexology'>reddit.com/r/vexology</a>.</p>

<p>Once you find a <strong>subreddit</strong> you like just click the subscribe button on the right side now all posts to that <strong>subreddit</strong> will appear on the reddit homepage when you&#8217;re logged in.</p>

<p><span>click subscribe</span></p>

<h2 id='understanding_reddit_culture'>Understanding reddit culture</h2>

<p>Reddit is a community of communities. Each community has it&#8217;s own rules, guidelines, and culture. You can normally find this information on the right side of each communities <strong>subreddit</strong> page. Before interacting with a community it&#8217;s a good idea to review this info.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re making your own community you&#8217;ll want to write out clear guidelines.</p>

<p>Also, if you are going to post a picture, upload it to <a href='//imgur.com'>imgur.com</a>. For what ever reason, reddit only likes pictures uploaded there.</p>

<h2 id='up_and_down_voting'>Up and Down voting</h2>

<p>All posts and comments on reddit have an up and down arrow. This allows you to <strong>upvote</strong> or <strong>downvote</strong> any content on the site. Each community has different guidelines around what voting means. Generally you <strong>upvote</strong> content that you feel adds to the community or current discussion. <strong>Downvotes</strong> tend to be used to &#8220;bury&#8221; off topic, mean spirited, or useless content. <strong>Downvotes</strong> aren&#8217;t a way to dismiss opinions that you disagree with!</p>
